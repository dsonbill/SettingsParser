SettingsParser
==============

SettingsParser is a **C#/.NET library** to make things easier for you. Tired of writing that long code for reading and writing simple `key=value` files? SettingsParser is the perfect library for you!

It is a library that writes values to a text file, and reads those values from the file! Instead of having a XML or JSON configuration file, you can have a configuration file with the `key=value` layout! 100% easier and human-readable!
